Understand Mattermost in Minutes
================================

Mattermost is a secure collaboration platform for accelerating your mission critical work consisting of 4 main areas: `left pane <#left-pane>`__, `center pane <#center-pane>`__, `right pane <#right-pane>`__, and `top bar <#top-bar>`__.

Left pane
----------

The left pane organizes your workspace and provides quick access to your conversations and settings. It includes:

- **Teams**: Switch between teams you belong to. You can also create new teams.
- **Channels & categories**: Switch between channels you're a member of. You can also create new channels and categories.
- **Direct Messages**: Reach out to people 1:1 or in groups of up to 8 people.
- **Favorite Channels**: Find your favorite channels fast at the top of your channel list.

Center pane
------------

The center pane is the heart of your Mattermost workspace where you’ll find the conversations happening in channels or direct messages. At the bottom of this area, you’ll see the most recent posts, and as you scroll up, you’ll see older messages—creating a constant timeline of activity.

Use the message input box at the bottom of this pane to send your messages or reply to others. For example: Share updates within a team channel, ask questions in a project-specific channel, or send files directly in a one-on-one chat.

Right pane
-----------

The right pane displays additional context and tools when you need them. 

When you click on a message thread, saved message, or pinned content, you’ll see the relevant details displayed here without leaving your workspace. You can also use the right pane to search across your workspace or find specific messages, files, or @mentions.

For example: Add a follow-up comment in a conversation thread, quickly find a document from the channel’s file list, or review a message you marked as important earlier.

Top bar
--------

The bar at the top of the app contains helpful tools including platform-wide navigation and search, channel information and options, recent mention filter, saved messages, settings, as well as profile and platform settings.
