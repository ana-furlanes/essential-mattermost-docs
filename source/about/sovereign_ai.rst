Implementing Sovereign AI
================================

.. index:: Sovereign AI, Copilot Plugin

Overview
-------

Sovereign AI is an approach to artificial intelligence implementation that prioritizes organizational control over data, processing, and infrastructure. In the context of Mattermost, this is realized through the Copilot Plugin, which enables organizations to leverage advanced AI capabilities though LLMs while maintaining complete control of their sensitive communications and information.

Sovereign AI has become increasingly critical as organizations seek to balance AI-enhanced productivity with stringent data sovereignty requirements. Mattermost's implementation through the Copilot Plugin enables organizations to maintain control over their data location, processing methods, and access controls throughout the AI interaction lifecycle.

Understanding Sovereign AI in Mattermost
--------------------------------------

Sovereign AI in Mattermost encompasses several key principles:

Data Sovereignty
  Organizations maintain complete control over their data, including where it resides, how it's processed, and who can access it.

Infrastructure Control
  Through the Copilot Plugin, organizations can choose their preferred LLM backend implementation, whether it's cloud-based services like OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, and Azure AI, or self-hosted models running on their infrastructure.

Extensible Architecture *(Future Capability)*
  The plugin ecosystem supports integration with various data sources and services, allowing organizations to incorporate their existing tools and data repositories into the AI workflow.

Mattermost Copilot Plugin Architecture
-----------------------------------

Core Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Mattermost Copilot Plugin serves as the foundation for Sovereign AI implementation, offering:

LLM Backend Flexibility
  * Self-hosted LLM deployment options
  * Integration with managed cloud provider LLMs (AWS Bedrock, Azure AI)
  * Support for cloud-based API services (OpenAI, Claude)
  * Custom LLM integration capabilities

Multi-Bot Architecture
  * Support for multiple concurrent AI bots
  * Different LLM backends per bot (e.g., OpenAI and self-hosted LLM simultaneously)
  * Customizable bot configurations, instructions, and capabilities
  * Independent access controls per bot

Vector Search Capabilities *(Future Capability)*
  * Self-hosted vector database options
  * Efficient semantic search across Mattermost content
  * Organization-wide content search through plugins

Data Integration Framework
  * Tool calling capabilities for external service integration
  * Support for data source plugins (e.g., Jira integration)
  * Access controls for all upstream data

Security and Privacy Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Copilot Plugin implements multiple layers of security controls:

Granular Access Management
  * Per-user access controls
  * Per-channel access controls
  * Bot-specific permissions

Implementation Options
-------------------

Deployment Patterns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Copilot Plugin supports various deployment patterns to match organizational needs:

Full Self-Hosted Implementation
  * Self-hosted Mattermost instance
  * Self-hosted LLM deployment
  * Local vector database installation
  * Complete infrastructure control
  * Air gap

Cloud Infrastructure Deployment
  * Mattermost instance hosted on cloud provider
  * LLM hosted by cloud provider, but private (e.g., AWS Bedrock, Azure AI)
  * Cloud vector database

Public LLM Integration
  * Mattermost instance hosted on cloud provider
  * LLM provided through API (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral La Plateforme)
